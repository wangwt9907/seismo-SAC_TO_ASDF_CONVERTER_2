#Bug report: email either of the guys listed above. They will be more than happy to see the problems.

Dependency:
Adios-1.5.0

How to use:
1. set up the "PAR_FILE" in the home(the home of the code) directory, which includes:
  a) DEBUG: debug mode
  b) Direcotry info: CMT, STATION, SAC file dir, etc
  c) Period Band
  d) Specify the three components name you want to convert.

2. make clean --> make clean

3. ./sac_to_asdf

Notes:
1. The code uses Parallel ASDF I/O API. But now the converter only works on one processor. Since now the ASDF I/O API is independent of number of processors, so do not worry about the converted file won't work on parallel way(if you use the same Parellel ASDF I/O API)

2. You can find complete Parallel ASDF I/O API in src/asdf_subs.f90. If you want to use these API, include the file in your source code.

TODO:
1. The infomation in the ASDF container needs to be improved(especially the time info is a little messed up here...will solve this soon!) You can find the contatiner information in src/asdf_data.f90
